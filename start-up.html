          to maintain a good relationship between the workers and the owner of the company. They can encourage the employees by providing incentives or partnership and so on. By this way it motivates the workers to tackle the problems with full
          enthusiasm. One has to be more concerned about the execution of the process according to the plan. Meanwhile they need to analyze the pros and cons of the way and try to fix it at the early stage. The most important work is to get the
          feedback from the customers simultaneously which would help them a lot later for analysis. They also need to take care of the use of resource frugal, because at the early stage of work it’s important to earn the trust rather than the
          profit. The start up companies should mainly focus on their workflow instead of focus on the profit basis.

        <p>
          For startups the way to find out the funding provided for them by any other companies or organization plays a vital role. It’s even odder to convince the investors for your new idea. Some may approach the banks or other fund providers for
          your investment in the business. Mostly for startups it might not require more investment, it’s completely based on the project they received and the requirement of resources to complete the work. The other way is to get partners for the
          establishment of business from your family or friends who might be willing to invest in business. The best way is to get partners with knowledge in managing finance might be more useful to maintain the economic growth of the company. They
          can also approach some other private investors by providing the possibility of the success of your idea in the real world and again their trust to motivate them to invest in your valuable project.

          expansion of their work they need to receive more orders from the customers. The most important thing in the idea of expansion is they need to recruit the employees with skills or they need a sufficient resource to train their employees to
          provide positive results in the growth of the company. The expansion may be achieved in other ways of collaborating with the other companies. This way might get more funding opportunities and get recognized by many of the people in the
          market about their great work and unique ideas. It might help to earn the brand name and reputation in the corporate world.
